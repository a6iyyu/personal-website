  **Getting to Know Programming with Classic Languages: Lua and Fortran**
</h1>
<br />
<br />
<h5 class="text-sm lg:text-base">
  Programming languages have been around for decades, and some of them are still
  widely used today. In this article, we'll explore two classic programming
  languages, i.e. Lua and Fortran. We'll dive into their history, how they work,
  and why they are still relevant in modern applications.
</h5>
<br />
<h3 class="text-lg lg:text-2xl">**Introduction**</h3>
<br />
<h5 class="text-sm lg:text-base">
  Lua is a lightweight and flexible programming language known for being simple
  but powerful. It is designed to be embedded into other applications, making it
  a popular choice for scripting. Lua is widely used in the gaming industry to
  control game logic and AI behavior. It is also used in web development to
  create dynamic websites and interactive applications.
  <br />
  Lua was first created in 1993 by Roberto Ierusalimschy, Luiz Henrique de
  Figueiredo, and Waldemar Celes at the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de
  Janeiro (PUC-Rio), Brazil. Their goal was to develop a language that was fast,
  efficient, and easy to embed into other software. One of Lua’s key features is
  dynamic typing, meaning you don’t need to specify the type of data a variable
  will hold. This makes coding more flexible and faster.
  <br />
  Over the years, Lua has become one of the most popular scripting languages in
  game engines like Unity and World of Warcraft. Its simplicity and adaptability
  make Lua a favorite for developers working on various types of software.
  <br />
  On the other hand, Fortran (short for Formula Translation) is one of the
  oldest programming languages still in use today. It was developed by IBM in
  the 1950s for scientific and engineering purposes. Fortran was designed to be
  easier to read and write compared to assembly language, making it a popular
  choice for numerical computing and data processing.
  <br />
  Fortran is known for its speed and efficiency, making it ideal for handling
  complex math calculations and scientific simulations. Today, Fortran is still
  used in fields like physics, engineering, meteorology, and astrophysics,
  especially for weather modeling and fluid dynamics.
  <br />
  Over the decades, Fortran has continued to evolve with new versions like
  Fortran 77, Fortran 90, and Fortran 2008, adding modern features like
  object-oriented programming and parallel computing. Even after more than 60
  years, Fortran remains a top choice for scientists and engineers because of
  its ability to handle heavy computational tasks quickly and efficiently.

<h3 class="text-2xl">**Install Lua**</h3>
<br />
<h5 class="text-sm lg:text-base">
  The Lua programming language is rarely mentioned among many programmers today,
  and its official documentation can feel outdated. Installing Lua on your
  device requires patience and attention to detail to ensure it runs smoothly.
  Therefore, the following section will guide you through the steps to download
  and install Lua on Windows.
</h5>
<ol class="ml-4 list-disc text-sm lg:text-base">
  <li>
    Visit LuaBinaries on [<u>SourceForge.</u>
    ](https://luabinaries.sourceforge.net/download.html) If your device runs
    Windows 64-bit, download **lua-5.4.2_Win64_bin.zip** and
    **lua-5.4.2_Win64_dllw6_lib.zip**. Otherwise, for Windows 32-bit, download
    **lua-5.4.2_Win32_bin.zip** and **lua-5.4.2_Win32_dllw6_lib.zip**.
  </li>
  <li>
    Choose a location with available space and create a new folder named **lua**
    for easy access. For example, create the folder at **C:/lua**.
  </li>
  <li>
    Move the downloaded zip files to the newly created folder (C:/lua) and
    extract them.
  </li>
  <li>
    You can simplify the file names by removing the version number. Rename
    **lua54.exe** to **lua.exe**, **luac54.exe** to **luac.exe**, and
    **wlua54.exe** to **wlua.exe**. Except for **lua54.dll**, don't try to
    rename it or your Lua installation will not be detected by the device.
  </li>
  <li>
    Open the Start Menu and search for Edit the system environment variables. In
    the User Variables section, click New.
  </li>
  <li>
    Enter a variable name (e.g., Lua) and set the path to the Lua folder
    (**e.g., C:/lua**). Click OK to save the changes.
  </li>
  <li>
    Then, open the Command Prompt and type **lua** to check if the installation
    was successful.
  </li>
</ol>
