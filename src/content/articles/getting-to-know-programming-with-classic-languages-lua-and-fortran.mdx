  **Getting to Know Programming with Classic Languages: Lua and Fortran**
</h1>
<br />
<br />
Programming languages have been around for decades, and some of them are still
widely used today. In this article, we'll explore two classic programming
languages, i.e. Lua and Fortran. We'll dive into their history, how they work,
and why they are still relevant in modern applications.
<br />
<h3 class="text-lg lg:text-2xl">**Introduction**</h3>
<br />
Lua is a lightweight and flexible programming language known for being simple
but powerful. It is designed to be embedded into other applications, making it a
popular choice for scripting. Lua is widely used in the gaming industry to
control game logic and AI behavior. It is also used in web development to create
dynamic websites and interactive applications.
<br />
Lua was first created in 1993 by Roberto Ierusalimschy, Luiz Henrique de
Figueiredo, and Waldemar Celes at the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de
Janeiro (PUC-Rio), Brazil. Their goal was to develop a language that was fast,
efficient, and easy to embed into other software. One of Lua's key features is
dynamic typing, meaning you don't need to specify the type of data a variable
will hold. This makes coding more flexible and faster.
<br />
Over the years, Lua has become one of the most popular scripting languages in
game engines like Unity and World of Warcraft. Its simplicity and adaptability
make Lua a favorite for developers working on various types of software.
<br />
On the other hand, Fortran (short for Formula Translation) is one of the oldest
programming languages still in use today. It was developed by IBM in the 1950s
for scientific and engineering purposes. Fortran was designed to be easier to
read and write compared to assembly language, making it a popular choice for
numerical computing and data processing.
<br />
Fortran is known for its speed and efficiency, making it ideal for handling
complex math calculations and scientific simulations. Today, Fortran is still
used in fields like physics, engineering, meteorology, and astrophysics,
especially for weather modeling and fluid dynamics.
<br />
Over the decades, Fortran has continued to evolve with new versions like Fortran
77, Fortran 90, and Fortran 2008, adding modern features like object-oriented
programming and parallel computing. Even after more than 60 years, Fortran
remains a top choice for scientists and engineers because of its ability to
handle heavy computational tasks quickly and efficiently.
<br />
<br />
<h3 class="text-2xl">**Install Lua**</h3>
<br />
The Lua programming language is rarely mentioned among many programmers today,
and its official documentation can feel outdated. Installing Lua on your device
requires patience and attention to detail to ensure it runs smoothly. Therefore,
the following section will guide you through the steps to download and install
Lua on Windows.
{/* prettier-ignore */}
<ol class="ml-4 list-disc">
  <li>
    Visit LuaBinaries on
    <a href="https://luabinaries.sourceforge.net/download.html" target="_blank" class="underline">SourceForge.</a>
    If your device runs Windows 64-bit, download **lua-5.4.2_Win64_bin.zip** and
    **lua-5.4.2_Win64_dllw6_lib.zip**. Otherwise, for Windows 32-bit, download
    **lua-5.4.2_Win32_bin.zip** and **lua-5.4.2_Win32_dllw6_lib.zip**.
  </li>
  <li>
    Choose a location with available space and create a new folder named **lua**
    for easy access. For example, create the folder at **C:/lua**.
  </li>
  <li>
    Move the downloaded zip files to the newly created folder (C:/lua) and
    extract them.
  </li>
  <li>
    You can simplify the file names by removing the version number. Rename
    **lua54.exe** to **lua.exe**, **luac54.exe** to **luac.exe**, and
    **wlua54.exe** to **wlua.exe**. Except for **lua54.dll**, don't try to
    rename it or your Lua installation will not be detected by the device.
  </li>
  <li>
    Open the Start Menu and search for **Edit the system environment
    variables**. In the User Variables section, click New.
  </li>
  <li>
    Enter a variable name (e.g., Lua) and set the path to the Lua folder
    (**e.g., C:/lua**). Click OK to save the changes.
  </li>
  <li>
    Then, open the Command Prompt and type **lua** to check if the installation
    was successful.
  </li>
</ol>
<br />

  **Writing Syntax and How To Run the First Program In Lua**
</h3>
<br />
When talking about the first program in any language, two magical words often
come to mind -- "Hello World." It's a fun and classic tradition. Interestingly,
writing a "Hello World" program in Lua looks almost identical to Python. Yes,
you heard that right! Here's a look at the Lua syntax and how to run it.
<br />
First, create a new file named **hello-world.lua** and get ready to dive into
the Lua environment.
<br />
```lua

    print("Hello, World!")


```
<br />
Next, press **CTRL + `** to open a new terminal. In the terminal, type **lua
hello-world.lua**.
<br />
<img src="/hello-world-in-lua.png" alt="Hello World In Lua" class="w-full" />
<br />
And just like that -- TADA! Your first Lua program is up and running!
<br />
<br />
<h3 class="text-2xl">**Pros and Cons of Lua**</h3>
<br />
Even if you're just getting to know Lua through the classic "Hello World"
program, you might already notice how its syntax feels a lot like natural
language. Lua's simplicity makes it a scripting language, meaning it uses
dynamic typing. While this flexibility is great, it often comes with a trade-off
-- Lua can be slower, much like Python.
<br />
Let's take a closer look at the pros and cons of Lua.
<br />
**Pros**
<ul class="ml-4 list-disc">
  <li>
    **Simple and Clean Syntax** -- With only about 22 basic keywords, learning
    Lua feels straightforward and beginner-friendly.
  </li>
  <li>
    **Highly Flexible** -- Lua doesn't lock you into strict rules, so you can
    shape it to fit different project needs.
  </li>
  <li>
    **Dynamic Typing** -- You don't need to specify the type of variables, Lua
    figures it out while the program runs.
  </li>
</ul>
<br />
**Cons**
<ul class="ml-4 list-disc">
  <li>
    **Small Community** -- It has a very small community of users, still
    relatively unknown next to Perl and Python languages.
  </li>
  <li>
    **Minimal Built-in Libraries** -- Lua's standard library is small, meaning
    you may need to write more code or rely on external libraries for advanced
    features. For example:
    <br />
    ```lua

        local file = io.open("example.txt", "r")

        if file then
            local content = file:read("a")
            print(content)
            file:close()
        else
            print("File not found!")
        end


    ```
    <br />
    The code above shows how Lua requires several manual steps to open and read
    files. And the result will be:
    <br />
    <img src="/minimal-built-in-libraries.png" class="w-full" />
    <br /> 
  </li>
  <li>
    **Lack of Native Multithreading** -- Lua doesn't support true multithreading
    out of the box, which can limit performance for more complex or parallel
    tasks. For example:
    <br />
    ```lua

        for i = 1, 5 do
            print("Task " ..i.. " started.")
            os.execute("sleep 1")
            print("Task " ..i.. " finished.")
        end


    ```
    <br />
    And the result will be:
    <br />
    <img src="/multithreading-in-lua.png" alt="Multithreading in Lua" class="w-full" />
    <br />
  </li>
</ul>
<br />
<br />
<hr class="h-0.5 border-slate-900" />
<br />
<br />
<h3 class="text-2xl">**Install Fortran**</h3>
<br />
On the other hand, the Fortran programming language is rarely mentioned today
due to its declining popularity amidst the evolving tech stack. A few decades
ago, Fortran was widely used by scientists, engineers, and researchers for tasks
involving complex mathematical calculations, simulations, and data analysis.
Despite its limited community and the difficulty in finding resources for
installing Fortran, the following section will guide you through the steps to
install Fortran on Windows.
{/* prettier-ignore */}
<ol class="ml-4 list-disc">
  <li>
    Visit the **MinGW - Minimalist GNU** for Windows project page on
    <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/" target="_blank" class="underline">SourceForge.</a>
    Click the download button to obtain the installer. The downloaded file will
    be named **mingw-get-setup.exe**.
  </li>
  <li>
    Once the download is complete, open the executable file to begin the
    installation process. Click the **Install** button and keep the default
    settings, just click the **Continue** button. The installer will proceed to
    set up MinGW on your system.
  </li>
  <li>
    After the installation finishes, launch the MinGW Installation Manager. In
    the manager, navigate to select the **mingw-developer-toolkit**,
    **mingw32-base**, and **mingw32-gcc-fortran**.
  </li>
  <li>
    **[Optional]** If you want to install additional programming languages, you
    can also check options like mingw32-gcc-ada, mingw32-gcc-g++, or
    mingw32-gcc-objc.
  </li>
  <li>
    Once the necessary components are selected, click **Mark for Installation**,
    then go to the **Installation** tab in the menu bar and choose **Apply
    Changes**.
  </li>
  <li>
    A confirmation window will appear--click **Apply** to proceed. The selected
    components, including Fortran, will begin downloading and installing.
  </li>
  <li>
    After the installation completes, go to the Start Menu and search **Edit the
    system environment variables**. In the System Variables section, click New.
  </li>
  <li>
    Set the path to the bin folder of MinGW (**e.g., C:\MinGW\bin**). Click OK
    to save the changes.
  </li>
  <li>
    Then, open the Command Prompt and type **gfortran -v** to check if the
    installation was successful.
  </li>
</ol>
<br />

  **Writing Syntax and How To Run the First Program In Fortran**
</h3>
<br />
Once again, we turn to the classic "Hello World" program. To me, writing Fortran
feels like following a process with a clear beginning and end. It's worth noting
that Fortran comes in several versions, including Fortran 1990, Fortran 1995,
Fortran 2003, and Fortran 2008 -- as listed by MinGW.
<br />
In this guide, we'll write your first Fortran program using the 2008 version and
walk through how to run it. Let's dive into the world of Fortran!
<br />
First, create a new file named **hello-world.f08** and prepare to explore the
Fortran environment.
<br />
```f08

    program hello_world
        implicit none
        print *, "Hello, World!"
    end program


```
<br />
Next, press **CTRL + `** to open a new terminal. In the terminal, type
**gfortran hello-world.f08 -o hello-world.exe**. This command compiles your
Fortran 2008 program and generates an executable file named **hello-world.exe**.
<br />
To run the program, type **./hello-world.exe** to see the result.
<br />
<img
  src="/hello-world-in-fortran.png"
  alt="Hello World In Fortran"
  class="w-full"
/>
<br />
And -- TADA! Your first Fortran 2008 program is successfully running!
<br />
<br />
<h3 class="text-2xl">**Pros and Cons of Fortran**</h3>
<br />
While Lua has a syntax that is more similar to human language, Fortran is more
challenging for beginners due to its more technical and rigid structure.
However, despite its perceived difficulty in learning, Fortran has endured for
decades thanks to its strength in mathematical calculations and scientific
applications. Its reliability in handling numerical computations and complex
data analysis has kept Fortran relevant in some fields, despite its declining
popularity in the era of modern programming languages.
<br />
Let's take a closer look at the pros and cons of Fortran.
<br />
**Pros**
<ul class="ml-4 list-disc">
  <li>
    **Better performance** -- Fortran is designed to tightly optimize code,
    making it difficult to write slow code.
  </li>
  <li>
    **Suitable for scientific computing** -- Fortran supports multidimensional
    arrays and number structures naturally, facilitating scientific
    calculations.
  </li>
  <li>
    **Excellent compatibility** -- Fortran ensures the code remains compatible
    with previous versions, allowing the code to last a long time without major
    changes.
  </li>
</ul>
<br />
**Cons**
<ul class="ml-4 list-disc">
  <li>
    **String Management Issues** -- Fortran has limited string management
    capabilities, including a less effective string concatenation function.
    For example:
    <br />
    ```f08

        program concat_string
            implicit none

            character(len=4) :: name = "John"
            character(len=3) :: surname = "Doe"

            result = trim(adjustl(name)) // '' // trim(adjustl(surname))

            print *, "My friend's name is", result
        end program


    ```
    <br />
    And do you know what the result is? The code above will generate an error
    because we haven't specified a type for the “result” variable. So, the
    correct code is:
    <br />
    ```f08

          program concat_string
              implicit none

              character(len=4) :: name = "John"
              character(len=3) :: surname = "Doe"
              character(len=8) :: result

              result = trim(adjustl(name)) // ' ' // trim(adjustl(surname))

              print *, "My friend's name is ", result
          end program


    ```
    <br />
    There's something even weirder. Suppose we reduce the len="4" of the
    variable "name" to len="3", what will happen?
    <br />
    <img src="/string-issue-in-fortran.png" alt="String issue in Fortran" class="w-full" />
    <br />
    Yep, the output will be “Joh Doe” only.
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>
    **Use of References for Argument** -- When calling subroutines, Fortran
    sends data via references instead of values, which may affect data
    protection.
  </li>
  <li>
    **GOTO Usage** -- In some cases, program flow control in Fortran still uses
    GOTO statements, which makes the code harder to follow and more error-prone.
  </li>
</ul>
