This page isn't all that important, but I think there are a few things here that
I really value... and honestly, I just love them. From my favorite songs and
games to my go-to programming languages -- it's all here. If you're not into it,
feel free to skip ahead!

<h3 class="mt-12 text-2xl font-bold">Favorite Songs</h3>
<h5 class="mt-4">
  Everyone's got their favorite songs -- and sometimes, music feels like the
  perfect way to let out "something." That something could be about a special
  someone, a precious moment, or just raw emotions. Out of the endless songs out
  there, I'm drawn to a few that hit different and stir up feelings I can't even
  explain. So, here's a list of my favorite tracks -- the ones I play on repeat
  while I'm out and about, in class, or winding down before bed.
